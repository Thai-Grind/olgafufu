# PhaserJS + Typescript

A simple starter template/example for PhaserJS and TypeScript.

## Requirements
- Node JS (v18+) with NPM

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Development (VS Code)

You can use the `Complete development` a Vite Dev Server and Chrome with the Debugger hooked up.

Putting/removing breakpoints in the `.ts` files with VS Code in `/src` should then work.
If it does not, please open an issue.

Edit the TypeScript files, the browser should automatically refresh after saving.

## Development (Terminal)

You can also start the development server by executing the following command within the repo:
```bash
npm run dev
```

You should then see the example in your Browser on http://localhost:5137/

## Publish to itch.io / Ludum Dare

You can create a zip file in a format that should work with both itch.io and Ludum Dare by running the following command :`npm run zip`
